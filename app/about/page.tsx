            He is known for leaning into highly stylized and aesthetic based film 
            work. Obsessing over the idea of cohesiveness between each piece of 
            production. From both shot to shot and department to department.
            Creating a living, breathing, and tangible world that can further 
            accentuate the emotions of our own is always the end goal.
